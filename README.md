# Brief notes
This was my first full-stack application implementing both a back end server, database and front end UI. This has been amazing practice in creating RESTful APIs and seeing firsthand how a client communicates with a server and vice versa. Being able to see persisting data across refreshes has been something I've been looking forward to finally implementing. I can't wait to begin exploring user authentication!

### Start server: 
  cd server <br>
  npm start
  
### Start client:

  cd client <br>
  npm install <br>
  npm run dev

### Stack:

  Back end - nodejs, express, postgres <br>
  Front end - react + vite, html, css + bootstrap
